# Cortex Agents in Snowflake

## Overview
This repository provides a beginner-friendly demonstration of the power of Cortex Agents in Snowflake. The demo is structured as a Jupyter Notebook, guiding users through the setup of Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst Services. By combining multiple services, we then build a Cortex Agent capable of delivering accurate responses based on PDF documents and structured data stored across multiple Snowflake tables.

## What are Cortex Agents?
Cortex Agents orchestrate both structured and unstructured data sources to deliver actionable insights. They:
- **Plan tasks**, selecting the right tools to execute them.
- **Use Cortex Analyst** for structured data (generating SQL queries).
- **Use Cortex Search** for unstructured data (extracting insights from documents and text).
- **Generate responses** using LLMs based on enterprise data.

## Cortex Agents Workflow
Cortex Agents follow a structured approach to problem-solving:
1. **Planning:** Determine the best approach to answer a user query.
2. **Explore Options:** Resolve ambiguous queries by considering different interpretations.
3. **Split into Subtasks:** Decompose complex requests into manageable parts.
4. **Route Across Tools:** Select and utilize the right tools for the task.
5. **Tool Use:** Execute queries via Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search.
6. **Reflection:** Evaluate results, refine the process, and generate a final response.
7. **Monitor & Iterate:** Continuously improve the agent’s performance.

## Demo Features
- **End-to-End Setup:** Step-by-step instructions to configure Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst.
- **Practical Examples:** Hands-on implementation showcasing structured and unstructured data integration.
- **Agent API Usage:** Learn how to query the Cortex Agents API using REST calls from within a Streamlit App running in Snowflake.
- **Streamlit Agent App:** Configure easily which Services your Agent should use and let the Agent figure out the right approach to answer your questions.

## Prerequisites
- A Snowflake Account
- 5 Minutes time  

Here you can get a free [Snowflake Trial Account](https://signup.snowflake.com/).

## Setup
All you need to do is to execute the following SQL statements in your Snowflake Account.  

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Create a warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS COMPUTE_WH WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE='X-SMALL';

-- Create a fresh Database
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO;

-- Create the API integration with Github
CREATE OR REPLACE API INTEGRATION GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO
    api_provider = git_https_api
    api_allowed_prefixes = ('https://github.com/michaelgorkow/')
    enabled = true
    comment='Git integration with Michael Gorkows Github Repository.';

-- Create the integration with the Github demo repository
CREATE GIT REPOSITORY GITHUB_REPO_CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO
	ORIGIN = 'https://github.com/michaelgorkow/snowflake_cortex_agents_demo' 
	API_INTEGRATION = 'GITHUB_INTEGRATION_CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO' 
	COMMENT = 'Github Repository from Michael Gorkow with a demo for Cortex Agents.';

-- Create stage for documents and semantic models
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE DOCUMENTS
  DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE)
  ENCRYPTION = ( TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE' );
  
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE SEMANTIC_MODELS
  DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE)
